# Creedexchange


Creedexchange is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange.


# What is Creedexchange ?
Creedexchange currently acts as an open source, updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development team. Although Creedexchange started as a fork of EtherDelta, considerable development time has been put towards a new token listing system, order book, API, and front-end UI all of which are at different stages of development and can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/Creedexchange). 


# How does Creedexchange  Work?
Creedexchange currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows TokenDEX users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume.

# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating.

However, this means that the trading fees still go to EtherDelta and ForkDelta Creedexchange development costs come entirely out of our pockets.
